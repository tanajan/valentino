# Valentino

Valentino is a fun and interactive Valentine's proposal project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The concept is simple: the user is presented with a proposal question, but if they keep clicking "No," the button moves randomly around the screen until the "Yes" button takes over

## 🎯 Features

A playful way to ask the ultimate Valentine's question.

The "No" button moves away when clicked.
